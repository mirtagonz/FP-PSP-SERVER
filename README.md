# Poverty Stoplight
Fundación Paraguaya (FP from now on) has developed a methodology called 
“Poverty Stoplight”. The Poverty Stoplight seeks to eliminate the 
multidimensional poverty that affects many families. It allows families to 
trace their own poverty map and develop and implement a clear plan to 
overcome it.

Through a visual survey that shows photographs, families self-assess their 
level of poverty with 50 indicators. These indicators are in turn grouped 
into 6 different dimensions of poverty.

# Get Started

* [Run the Server.](docs/RUN.md)

# Poverty Stoplight Platform
The PSP (Poverty Stoplight Platform) is a set of components that assist 
people in the process of acquiring data, analyzing and helping the families 
with solution to overcome his poverty.

The PSP-server is a Spring Boot application that expose a REST API to 
diferent components (i.e. an Andorid Application)

# Status of the project
The project is just starting and we expect to have a running version by the 
end of the year.

The platform is currently being developed by a group of developers 
from FP and SODEP. We welcome help from other developers, but we understand 
that the project is still in its early days.

Since we have a comprise to remain an open source project, we decided to push
 it to github and let everybody know our progress.

# Code of conduct

# Test environment

# Issue Tracking
We've decided to use our internal issue tracking for fastest communication in
 the development team. We are going to use pull requests from day one and we are
 planning to move to github tickets once we reach a stable version.
